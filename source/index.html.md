# Introduction

Welcome to the Snappr API! You can use our API to commission and manage photoshoots within the Snappr marketplace network. The API is available only to organizations using the Snappr enterprise Photography Portal. If you do not currently have a Photography Portal account and are interesting in setting one up, find out more <a href="https://www.snappr.co/partner">here</a>.

We have language bindings in Shell and JavaScript. You can view code examples in the panel on the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs on the top-right.

# Authentication

```shell
curl "/example-endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer zkTvDUe5jJBJFcjc6ckwapEwax8Kbs7h3nv2SHXSgh5qGhHP22ggsu4fbdZgf25z"
```

```javascript
const snappr = require('snappr-api');

let api = snappr.authorize(
  'zkTvDUe5jJBJFcjc6ckwapEwax8Kbs7h3nv2SHXSgh5qGhHP22ggsu4fbdZgf25z'
);
```

> Replace the example key above with your API key. This fake key is used in all of the following request examples.

Snappr uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can access or regenerate your API key from your Photography Portal GUI. Each user has a single unique active API key. Regenerating your API key will deactivate your previous key. Deleting a user will deactivate their API key.

An API key needs to be included in all API requests in a header of this format:

<code>Authorization: Bearer <span class="route_param">api_key</span></code>

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>api_key</code> with your user API key.

You can set a custom webhook URL in the Snappr Photography Portal GUI. If the custom webhook URL is set, we will POST to that URL every time a booking is created or updated.

### Setting URL

Click on the 'API' link in the top-right drop-down menu in your Photography Portal, or go to the following URL:

<code>https://app.snappr.co/partner/<span class="route_param">your-slug</span>/api</code>

Replace <code>your-slug</code> with your company's custom Snappr slug.

Go to the 'Custom Webhook' section and click the 'Edit' button in the URL field. Type in the receiving URL of your choice, then click the 'Save' button. If you entered a valid URL, that endpoint will now start receiving all booking updates.
